Product Description

The game is a variation of the classic game of checkers, with some elements from the Mario video game franchise. There will be two players, each with a set of characters, or checkers, lined up on their side. Behind the checker on the first and last rows will be a row of tunnels. Players will alternate turns moving their pieces. Regular checkers can only move diagonally, but can move as many spaces diagonally as desired. Checkers cannot land on another checker, but if an opponent’s checker is jumped, that checker will be removed from the game. If a player makes it a tunnel on the opposite side of the board, the checker will be moved back to the opposite side, and be “kinged”. Checkers produce sounds when they jump another checker and when they are kinged. Kinged checkers have a different image than regular checkers, and have the improved ability to move whichever direction they like. Mushrooms will be added to the board after a random number of turns. If a player lands on a mushroom, it will be automatically kinged. Bombs will also be added to the board after a random number of turns. If a players lands on a bomb, it will be removed from the game. The game is finished when all of one player’s checkers have been removed from the board. The winner of the game will be the player who has checkers on the board at the game’s completion.
